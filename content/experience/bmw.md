### Software Developer for Vehicle Functions

I exploited the knowledge acquired until this point to reach "the final point of the product development": I started to work as a contractor for the [BMW Group](https://www.bmwgroup.com/en.html). 🚙

The Vehicle Functions are systems or features in a car (e.g., braking, steering) that performs a specific task. Their development requires strict compliance with safety standards to ensure reliability and prevent failures, protecting passengers and others on the road. 🛡️

The development is ***end-to-end***: the most ingenious ideas are evaluated, the best ones are implemented and tested on real vehicles. 🧪

I cut it short, yet the process involves rigorous testing, risk assessments, and design safeguards to meet legal and safety requirements. 👨🏼‍⚖️

Needless to say, the real-world testing of your ideas and their implementation is priceless. That is why I learnt how to drive vehicle prototypes... and yes, I develop and test today the vehicles which will be driven tomorrow! 🏁

Given the company size, so big that it can be seen as an agglomerate of smaller companies, I continue improving my communication skills to pass on the best practices in Software Development. 👨🏼‍💻

Results:
* Development according to the ISO26262 standard, to achieve the highest safety
* Online estimation of vehicle dynamic wheel radii from 2s to 300 ms
* Sensor signals filtering with noise prevention
* Reduction of time complexity of a rolling variance computation algorithm by 300% on a vehicle ECU
* Real-time algorithm to acknowledge if a vehicle is in offroad conditions, by using limited information about sensors only
