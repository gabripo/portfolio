### Software Developer with focus on Simulation

I reached the meeting point between university studies and industry when I first got into Software Development for simulations. ‚å®Ô∏è

Given the many years I spent in the company, I covered different role:
I started to mantain and extend a piece of software in [Vector DYNA4](https://www.vector.com/int/en/products/products-a-z/software/dyna4/) related to a virtual environment for tire simulations, joined the Customer Support team with worldwide coverage, transformed requirements into delivered solutions for a Hardware-In-The-Loop (HiL) project with [Volkswagen](https://www.vw.com/en.html), then built an accurate Driving Simulator for scientific research. üõû

Apart from the technical aspects, I learnt a lot in the area of communication through frequent trainings and practical scenarios like Customer Support and Project Management. üìö

Another thing I am proud of is having mastered the [German language](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/33216-life-is-too-short-to-learn-german) to the point I can seamlessy use it for business purposes.

Results:
* Enhanced modeling and simulation of a vehicle tire and steering system, which led to an accuracy improvement by 23% on a Hardware-in-the-Loop system
* Development and technical support of a driving simulator with steering torque feedback
* Modular modeling for different vehicle drivetrain topologies, allowing multiple licensing configuration
* Adoption of third-party tire models with enhancements in numerical stability
