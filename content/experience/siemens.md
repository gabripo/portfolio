### Internship in vehicle simulation

My first contact with the industry was during the end of my studies, in a big corporate like [Siemens](https://www.sw.siemens.com/en-US/solutions/product-lifecycle-management-plm/). 🏢

The interest for Mechatronics and vehicles led me to pursue a thesis about simulation: 👨🏼‍💻
> ***Appropriate model fidelity for testing Automated Driver Functionalities in highly dynamic scenarios***

The main topic of the thesis was to compare different simulation models, some complex and other simplified, in order to identify the right trade-off between complexity and usability in Advanced Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS). 🚘

Results:
* Hands-on learning of the Siemens Multibody simulation tool (Virtual.Lab Motion or Simcenter Motion) for creating a multi-body model of a vehicle
* Hands-on learning of the lumped parameter modeling tool LMS Imagine.Lab AMESim
* Modeling vehicle functions such Anti-lock Braking System (ABS), Electronic Power Steering (EPS), Electronic Stability Program (ESP)
* Establishing the basis for further research about the influence of vehicle modeling about ADAS testing
