What is the best way to start a career in Engineering?
**Build something!**

The [Formula Student](https://www.imeche.org/events/formula-student/) is an international competition among universities: each university is represented by a team of students who design, build and test a racing car. 🏎️

The competition requires the students to be creative and pragmatic at the same time, since the development cycle involves design challenges as well as realization pitfalls:
The competition rules are strict, the final design choices are analyzed by experienced judges, the time is never enough. ⏰

I was excited when I co-founded the team to represent my university, especially because the project was about an electric racing car, it started from the scratch and I could lead a small team of 4 people. 🔋

My experience concluded with a test on the field: I attended the Italian competition in Varano De Melegari on July 2017.
It was the very first year for the team, yet the car was mechanically ready. ⚙️

Balancing the experience together with the university studies was tough, nonetheless the final result was rewarding. 🏅

Results:
* Design and realization of the gearbox and half shaft for power transmission between electric motors and tires.
* External chassis of the battery pack, designed to allow liquid cooling.
